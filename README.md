The 1001 Paper Cranes Project

The BR office used to have a paper crane installation that we would like to bring back. We plan to fold at least 1,001 paper cranes, string them up and place them on one of the walls at the BR office. We are looking for team members to help fold! You can either stick around the whole time or come and go as you can. We just need to have at 1,001 paper cranes by the end of the first night to string together!

Those that are remote can sign up as well and we'll mail supplies to you two weeks before the project. Please let us know how many cranes you're committed to folding.

_One thousand origami cranes (千羽鶴, senbazuru; literally “1000 cranes”) is a group of one thousand origami paper cranes (折鶴, orizuru) held together by strings. An ancient Japanese legend promises that anyone who folds a thousand origami cranes will be granted a wish by the gods. Some stories believe one is granted happiness and eternal good luck, instead of just one wish, such as long life or recovery from illness or injury. This makes them popular gifts for special friends and family. The crane in Japan is one of the mystical or holy creatures (others include the dragon and the tortoise) and is said to live for a thousand years: That is why 1000 cranes are made, one for each year. In some stories it is believed that the 1000 cranes must be completed within one year and they must all be made by the person who is to make the wish at the end.
