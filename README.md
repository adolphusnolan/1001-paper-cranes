# 1001-paper-cranes

The GraphQL API for the 1001 Paper Cranes Project... because every cranes deserves a story.

![Alt text](1001-Paper-Cranes.png?raw=true "Title")

The Bottle Rocket office used to have a paper crane installation that we would like to bring back. We planned to fold at least 1,001 paper cranes, string them up and place them on one of the walls at headquarters. We got the support of nearly 50 team members to help design these beautiful cranes.

This year we wanted to commemorrate this new sedge of cranes by giving each one a story - a word of wisdom if you will. We've written a useful API that anyone can use to test their new app, explore GraphQL or just get inspired. The spirit of each of our paper cranes was inspired by 1,001 quotes that we hold dear.

###  References...
_One thousand origami cranes (千羽鶴, senbazuru; literally “1000 cranes”) is a group of one thousand origami paper cranes (折鶴, orizuru) held together by strings. An ancient Japanese legend promises that anyone who folds a thousand origami cranes will be granted a wish by the gods. Some stories believe one is granted happiness and eternal good luck, instead of just one wish, such as long life or recovery from illness or injury. This makes them popular gifts for special friends and family. The crane in Japan is one of the mystical or holy creatures (others include the dragon and the tortoise) and is said to live for a thousand years: That is why 1000 cranes are made, one for each year. In some stories it is believed that the 1000 cranes must be completed within one year and they must all be made by the person who is to make the wish at the end._
